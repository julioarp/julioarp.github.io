# Julio A. Ramos Pastrana

Hello, welcome to my personal website. 

I am an applied microeconomist with over 7 years of experience leveraging economic theory, econometric analysis, and cost-benefit methodologies to assess and enhance the impact of development projects.  

I am currently an impact evaluation consultant at the Inter-American Development Bank and an External Faculty Affiliate at the Ostrom Workshop at Indiana University. 

I am skilled in translating complex data into actionable insights to improve policy effectiveness and project outcomes. I have experience in international organizations, academia and government. 

I have published more than a dozen policy relevant peer-reviewed economic papers in the areas of development economics, public finance, telecommunications, health and institutional economics using impact evaluation techniques.
